                        <h3>Kevin D Franklin</h3>
                        <p>Welcome to my personal website. I'm Kevin D. Franklin, and I'm pleased to have you visit my bio page. You'll find information on projects I've worked on, books I've written, and what is in the works or coming soon. You're welcome to look around, and as we say in the south, "Make yourself at Home! If you'd like to discuss something or ask a question, just follow the link to my contact page.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Author & Creator Bio</h4>
                        <p>I'm a Louisiana based writer, early AI adopter and enthusiast, full-stack AI assisted developer, and forward-thinking technology innovator. After over two decades as a technology leader in self-supported value-added sales, I began pursuit of a lifelong passion for creating platforms like AutoDevelop.ai and ThemeBotPark.com. I endured more than a year of sleep deprivation creating The Agential Gold Rush. I'm actively involved in decentralized tech like Web3 and blockchain smart contracts. I strive to build with a commitment to purpose. Evaluating projects by how much they benefit users and society.</p>
                        
                        <h4>Experience</h4>
                        <p>My background is in Computer Science, attending LSU in Baton Rouge, LA for 2 years before taking a semester off to go on a Sales job cross country to earn some cash. That semester turned into a lifetime, eventually earing a degree from Northweastern State University in the mid-2000's while working as a Sales Representitive at the same company I've stuck with all these years. For over two decades I've worked for the same company. I'm Sales Manager and support the IT side of the solutions along with our great service department. All of our Sales Reps also support the solutions they sell as a value added differentiator to the other alternitives. I maintain our Server, Managed Switches, and network, with VPN accross two locations. My passion for software development has stayed with me, so a few years ago I decided it was time to pick it back up again and start to create some of the ideas I've had over the years. It's been some of the most personally rewarding work I've done to date. I look forward to sharing with the world what's contained in this unconventional, some call rational, brain. Sign up for updates to keep up with new products and inovations comming down the line.</p>
